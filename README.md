# Quantum Machine Learning
These notebooks are part of the [Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-machine-learning) course offered in EdX. Here is the [original repo](https://gitlab.com/qosf/qml-mooc). 

However, I plan to make some heavy changes in most of the notes I have already updated some of them and I am in the process of changing others. Some of the standard changess include the using latest qiskit version in the notebooks and removing the deprecated functions.

I also plan to add a few chapters from [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) in the middle in order to make the course a complete cource for any one from beginner level to the more advanced level.  Please refere to the [actual git repo](https://github.com/anpaschool/QC-School-Fall2020) for the updates on Quantum Computing class -Fall 2020
